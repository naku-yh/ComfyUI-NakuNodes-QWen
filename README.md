I modified this node only to remove the emojis and apply a Chinese localization in my preferred style. I did not change the source code.


QwenImageIntegratedKSampler

This is an integrated ComfyUI Qwen-Image image generation sampler node,support Z-Image. Compared to using the official KSampler, it eliminates the messy wiring, supports both text-to-image and image-to-image generation, solves the offset issues of the official nodes, and integrates prompt input box, automatic image scaling, automatic memory/vRAM cleanup, batch generation, automatic saving and other comprehensive optimization features, so mom no longer has to worry about my messy wiring~~~~

#### If this project helps you, please give it a ⭐Star — it lets me know there are humans out there using it!

## 🍧 Comparison Display
### Workflow Complexity Comparison
- **Workflow without using [Qwen Image Integrated KSampler] (complicated, too many nodes, too many wires)**

- **Workflow using [Qwen Image Integrated KSampler] (extremely simple, single node done, almost no wires)**


### Generated Image Effect Comparison
- **Workflow without using [Qwen Image Integrated KSampler] (obvious offset, scaling)**

- **Workflow using [Qwen Image Integrated KSampler] (completely no offset, scaling)**


## Installation Method

### Method 1: Via ComfyUI Manager (Recommended)
1. Open ComfyUI Manager in the ComfyUI interface
2. Search for "ComfyUI-Qwen-Image-Integrated-KSampler"
3. Click Install

### Method 2: Manual Installation
1. Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naku-yh/ComfyUI-NakuNodes-QWen.git

## 🚀 Usage Method

### [Workflow Example](workflow_example.json)

### Basic Text-to-Image Generation

1. Add the "NAKU 专用 QWEN集成采样器" node to the workflow
2. Set `generation_mode` to "text-to-image"
3. Connect required inputs:
   - Model (Model)
   - CLIP (Clip)
   - VAE (Vae)
4. Enter positive and negative prompts
5. Set width and height (required for text-to-image)
6. Configure sampling parameters (steps, CFG, sampler, scheduler)
7. Execute the workflow

### Image-to-Image Generation

1. Add the node to the workflow
2. Set `generation_mode` to "image-to-image"
3. Connect at least one reference image (Image1)
4. Optionally add up to 4 other reference images
5. Enter positive/negative prompts and instructions
6. Set target width/height for scaling (optional)
7. Configure other parameters as needed
8. Execute the workflow

### ControlNet Control

1. Add the [NAKU 专用 QWEN-ControlNet Integrated Loader] node, connect to [ControlNet Data]

2. Connect pose, depth control images

3. Select ControlNet model, set control type and strength

4. Execute the workflow


### Advanced Features

- **Memory Management**: Enable GPU/CPU cleanup options to improve resource efficiency
- **Batch Processing**: Set batch_size > 1 for multiple image generation
- **Auto-Save**: Specify output folder for automatic saving
- **AuraFlow Tuning**: Adjust auraflow_shift to balance speed and quality
- **CFG Enhancement**: Stabilizer for CFG

## ⚠️ Notes

### Usage Requirements
- **Text-to-Image Mode**: Must set width (Width) and height (Height), these are required parameters
- **Image-to-Image Mode**: Must provide at least one reference image (Image1), supports up to 5 reference images (Image1-Image5)

### 🎛️ Parameter Setting Suggestions
- **Batch Size**: Choose between 1-10, adjust according to GPU memory, recommend starting testing from 1
- **Resolution (Width/Height)**: Must be multiples of 8, range 0-16384, recommend starting testing from lower resolutions (like 512x512)
- **Sampling Steps**: Qwen models recommend 4-20 steps, too high may increase computation time but not necessarily improve quality
- **CFG Value**: Range 0-100, default 1.0, recommend 1.0-7.0 range
- **Denoise Strength**: Range 0-1, default 1.0, can lower appropriately in image-to-image mode
- **AuraFlow Shift**: Range 0-100, default 3.0, used to balance generation speed and quality
- **CFG Normalization Strength**: Range 0-100, default 1.0, stabilizer for CFG

### 🔧 Image Processing
- **Automatic Scaling**: Text-to-image must input width and height parameters, image-to-image fills in to auto-scale reference images while maintaining aspect ratio, setting either width or height to 0 disables scaling
- **Reference Image Order**: Supports up to 5 reference images, processed in order Image1-Image5, Image1 is the main image
- **Image Format**: Supports standard image input formats, automatically handles batch dimensions

### 💾 Memory Management
- **GPU Memory Cleanup**: Enable enable_clean_gpu_memory option, automatically clean VRAM before/after generation
- **CPU Memory Cleanup**: Enable enable_clean_cpu_memory_after_finish, clean RAM after generation completes (including file cache, processes, dynamic libraries)
- For continuous large-scale generation, it is recommended to always enable memory cleanup options to prevent memory overflow

### 💾 Auto-Save
- **Output Folder**: Set auto_save_output_folder to enable auto-save function, leave blank to disable, supports absolute and relative paths
- **File Naming**: output_filename_prefix custom prefix, default "auto_save"
- Save format is PNG, filename includes seed and batch number (e.g.: auto_save_123456_00000.png)

### Notification Function
- **Sound Notification**: Only supported on Windows systems
